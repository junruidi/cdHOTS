Title: Construct and Decomposes Higher Order Tensorian Statistics
Description: Construct higher order staistics (higher order standardized moments) in the
             formats of higher order tensors. Decomposes those tensors using higher oder 
             SVD (HOSVD) or robust power tensor iteration.
